# A Tank Game

[Online demo](https://remtori.github.io/ATG/)

## Ideas

- Game mode: Bot Fight (x v 8), Team Fight (8 v 8), Quick Fight (1 v 1 v ... v 16), Capture the flag (8 v 8)

- Customizable: The table below show the advantage and disadvantage when increasing the component size

| Component     | Advantage | Disadvantage |
|---------------|-----------|--------------|
| Tank Width    | + Health  <br> + Higher Cooldown Speed            | - Movement Speed       <br> - Rotation Speed |
| Tank Length   | + Health  <br> + Accuracy<br> + Lower Recoil Impact            | - Movement Speed       <br> - Rotation Speed |
| Barrel Width  | + Shell Damage  <br> + Shell Size <br> + Shell Health | - Movement Speed       <br> - Rotation Speed<br> - Barrel Rotation Speed<br> - Higher Cooldown Time |
| Barrel Length | + Accuracy<br> + Shell Age                       | - Movement Speed       <br> - Rotation Speed<br> - Barrel Rotation Speed |

- Overheating mechanism: When fire shell increase the heat by some amount, if the heat excess a thresh hold, you can no longer fire

- Recoil: When fire a shell a recoil force is apply to the tank, the bigger the shell, the stronger the force. The force will be stronger if the fired shell is parallel to the tank. (TL;DR place the barrel perpendicular to the tank then fire)

### Player vs Computer

- Repair pack to heal 10% health

- Garage as checkpoint and switch to new tank

## Levels (for PvC)

### Level One

- Mini boss that can only be beaten by fast moving tank

- Final boss that can only be beaten by slow strong - long range fire power tank

- Balanced tank is easier to clear the mobs
